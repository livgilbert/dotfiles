Nothing too crazy but might as well put them out there.

Starring: 
 - WM: `i3`
 - Terminal: `kitty`
 - Launcher/Thing-Doer: `rofi`
 - Status Bar: `polybar`
 - Compositor: `picom`
 - Color Scheme: `nord`

All needed fonts are provided in `fonts`. Polybar and i3 use Noto Sans (with the Nerd Font addition for things that require icons) and kitty uses Source Code Pro.

The vimrc is pretty basic, I've only been using vim for a few months, mostly for LaTeX notes.
